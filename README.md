# Pioneers of Plymouth
Pioneers of Plymouth is a Settlers of Catan game clone which was made to
be free, open-source, and server-based.
It was made as existing Settlers of Catan video games are not stable.

There is no license, as I doubt it can be licensed at all. Use and
modify it how you please, you can always contact me from my
[profile](https://github.com/zbee/) or [keybase](https://keybase.io/zbee).
I will try to make the setup of your own instance of Pioneers of Plymouth
as simple as possible.
This does use a modified version of
[zbee/UserSystem](https://github.com/zbee/usersystem) which is licensed under
GPLv3.

Please read the [installation document](INSTALL.md) if you want to spin up your
own instance. I want to also switch my systems over to Heroku, and then offer
a [Heroku button](https://elements.heroku.com/buttons) to instantly spin up an
instance.
